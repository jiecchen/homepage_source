In this page, papers/books that I have read will be selectively kept. Most papers will be related to algorithms, especially Randomized Algorithms and Approximation Algorithms. Topics in pure mathematics might also be covered. My criteria to select a paper:

+ must be beautiful
+ with original idea
+ *might* have applications in real life

I might also compile a summary for those selected papers in the future.

For books, they can be in any topic, mathematics, computer science, literature, culture study, history, philosophy etc. No particular criteria for books, they would be listed here as long as they are interesting and let me know something new. A short summary or relatively long review might also be attached.

# List of Papers
Papers will be roughly categorized based on their major topics. Lecture notes, if elegant enough, will also be included in my list. One good example is the lecture notes on [Streaming Algorithms](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~ac/Teach/CS49-Fall11/Notes/lecnotes.pdf) by [Amit Chakrabarti](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~ac/) @ Dartmouth.

## Spectral Graph Theory

+ [Graph sparsification by effective resistances](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.0929.pdf)
by *Spielman, Daniel A., and Nikhil Srivastava. SIAM Journal on Computing 40.6 (2011): 1913-1926.*
+ [The Sketching Complexity of Graph Cuts](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.7058.pdf)
by *Andoni, Alexandr, Robert Krauthgamer, and David P. Woodruff. arXiv preprint arXiv:1403.7058 (2014).*

## Theory of Probability

## Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra

## Streaming Algorithms 


# List of Books


## Popular Philosophy

+  [The conquest of happiness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51783.The_Conquest_of_Happiness).
by *Russell, Bertrand. Routledge, 2006.*

## Fiction/Literature

+ [川端康成小说选](http://book.douban.com/subject/2142573/)
by *Yasunari Kawabata.*

> Such a great book! I read several Yasunari's fictions when I was around fifteen, they were not very impressive to me at that time. My opinion was totally changed after rereading his work recently. 

## Mathematics

## History

+ [Embracing defeat: Japan in the wake of World War II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embracing_Defeat)
by *Dower, John W.*

+ [The Singapore Story: Memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/326981.The_Singapore_Story)
by *Lee, Kuan Y.*

> I read in Chinese, interesting and unique reading experience. Lee Kuan Yew is *THE* person to tell the story of Singapore.
